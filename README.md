## Overview

**Project Title**: Stock Market Data Analysis

**Project Description**: Using Python and Pandas I will analize data from the stock market with 2 questions in mind. Which company provides the most returns in dividens and what industry has the highest Price/Earning.

**Project Goals**: I want to be able to analyse the data and understand the infromation enough to create good questions. Once I find good questions I want to be able to make not obnly data tables but also some visualy intersting graphs that show the data.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. You must have the proper Develop Enviorment set up (see section Below)
2.
3.

Instructions for using the software:

1. I set the program up so that it would first display trhe questions, and then the data related to that question, and then an explaination of what the conculsion based on the data is. In order to move to the next section just press enter

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* Stock Market Data from Kaggle

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [10 Minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)
* [Complete Python Pandas Data Science Tutorial!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)
* [How to plot a Pandas Dataframe with Matplotlib](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-a-pandas-dataframe-with-matplotlib/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [I want to learn more about how to make the grapghs more visually appealing and the many options that are avalible for graphing ] 
* [I want to learn about how to create relationships between different data sets so I can add more in the future] 
* [ ]
